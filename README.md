# MangaNest · Multi-Site Manga Downloader

📖 Full usage guide: `Docs/Usage.md` (main UI walkthrough + download flow + adding sites + FAQ)

A manga downloader that runs on Windows and supports multiple manga websites: built-in crawlers + custom site adapters (JSON rules) + an Auto Site Analyzer wizard — paste any new website, the program automatically analyzes its search/chapter/image structure and generates a reusable adapter.

**v1.1 new features**: 🔄 **Format Converter page** (turn downloaded manga images into PDF / CBZ / EPUB / MOBI e-books — one-click whole-book merge, multi-folder merge, automatic original cover), **startup self-check** (writes diagnostic logs), **one-click network-stack repair** script.

**v1.1.1 new features**: 🔐 **Secure Login Vault** — login sessions are now stored in an **AES-256-GCM encrypted container**:
- **Device-bound**: opens automatically on THIS PC (hardware fingerprint) — no password needed
- **Password unlock** for other computers (PBKDF2 200k iterations)
- **Auto-destroy**: 4 wrong passwords → all saved login data is permanently destroyed
- **Password rule**: at least 6 characters, must contain **letters + digits + symbols** (e.g. `Abc@123`)
- **Auto-login**: after logging in once, the program automatically uses the saved container — no more QR scans
- New **🔐 Password Manager** page (fold menu in the sidebar): view container status / set & change password / test password / clear container

**v1.1.2 new features**: ❓ **Security Question verification** - set a **custom security question** when creating the container password (e.g. "What is my hobby?" / "Name of my favorite person", free text, no length limit):
- Changing the password **requires answering the security question correctly** (retry allowed, no auto-destroy)
- Answer stored as a salted hash (only THIS PC can verify; other computers cannot read it)
- Forgot your password on this PC? Answer the security question -> reset a new password

**v1.1.3 new features**: :mag: **Vault Access Verification** & :shield: **Program Integrity Detection**:
- **Vault access verification**: opening the :lock: Password Manager now requires the container password **even on this PC** - anyone trying to view or modify saved passwords must verify first. Browser auto-login/download stays seamless on this PC (device fingerprint); only the password vault itself demands verification
- **Program integrity detection (anti-tamper)**: on first run the program fingerprints its own core files (AES-GCM encrypted, device-bound). If the program files are modified by anyone, startup warns you and the Password Manager **forces you to re-enter the container password** before use; a successful verification resets the integrity baseline (intended for your own program updates)

**v1.2.0 new features**: :framed_picture: **Universal Image Downloader page** (inspired by KoManga-Utils, rebuilt & enhanced) — a new sidebar page between Format Converter and Password Manager:
- **URL template download**: batch-download images from a URL pattern with `${key}` placeholder, e.g. `http://IP:8080/img/${key}.jpg` (start/end pages + thread count)
- **Web page image download**: paste any web URL → auto-extract every `<img>` (incl. lazy `data-src`) and download them all — the fallback for sites without an adapter
- **HTML source image download**: paste raw HTML → extract image URLs (src / data-src / data-original / data-lazy-src) and download with progress bar
- Enhanced vs. the original tool: random User-Agent, automatic retry (x2), per-format saving (jpg/png/webp/gif), live progress, threaded (UI never blocks), full usage guide built into the page

**v1.2.1 fix**: :wrench: **Self-check & stability fixes**:
- **Startup script check fixed**: previously the self-check looked for `start.bat`/`start.vbs` and always reported them missing (the project actually uses `一键启动.bat`) — it now accepts any of `start.bat` / `start.vbs` / `一键启动.bat` / `一键启动.vbs`, so no more false "missing" warnings
- **Summary verdict fixed**: the self-check summary only reports real problems now; optional-module warnings (e.g. `bs4`/`img2pdf`) no longer make the result show "异常"
- **Optional dependencies installed**: `beautifulsoup4` + `img2pdf` added to the requirements list (fully optional, warnings removed on fresh installs)

**v1.3 new features**: :books: **Local Manga Library & One-Click Updates**:
- New **📚 Local Library** sidebar page: pick any folder as your library root, scan it, and browse every downloaded manga with its chapters
- **Check for Updates**: compares your local chapters against the site and lists exactly the missing chapters — **smart episode-number ("Total X") tracking** understands chapter folders named like `总676·双双被擒？` (no numeric prefix) as well as `808 总696·...` folders, so a library that is already up to date reports "up to date" instead of a wall of false misses
- **Latest-episode comparison** in the status bar (local vs. site), plus a hint when your local folder has far fewer chapters than the site (chapters may be scattered in other folders)
- **Download new chapters**: one click downloads every missing chapter straight into your library
- **Check bad images**: verifies every downloaded image (magic bytes + minimum size), lists and deletes bad/unrelated images with automatic re-download (downloader-level too: images are checked right after each download)

**v1.3.1 security upgrade**: :lock: **Argon2id key derivation** (OWASP-recommended, memory-hard, GPU brute-force resistant):
- Vault password derivation upgraded from PBKDF2 to **Argon2id** (64 MiB / 3 iterations / 4 lanes); **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption retained for vault data
- Old v1 vaults stay fully compatible and are **auto-upgraded to Argon2id** when you change the password
- Fixed: destroyed vaults no longer count as password-protected for the main-program lock
- Program-integrity lock now only activates **after a password has been set** (no popup on a fresh install); once set, modified program files require the password to unlock
- Self-check Python-version comparison bug fixed (3.10 no longer misreported as old)

## 1. UI Guide

After launch (double-click `start.bat`), the main window has four pages in the left sidebar (plus a collapsible **🔐 Password Manager** menu below Universal Image Downloader):

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 🏠 **Home** | Download comics: site selector, search, load chapter list, start download |
| 📚 **Local Library** | Scan downloaded folders, browse chapters, **check for updates**, download new chapters, verify bad images |
| 🔄 **Format Converter** | Merge downloaded manga images into e-books (PDF/CBZ/EPUB/MOBI) |
| 🖼 **Universal Image Downloader** | URL-template / web-page / HTML-source batch image download (built-in usage guide) |
| 🔐 **Password Manager** | Click `🔐 密码管理 ▸` to expand → open the vault manager page (encrypted login containers) |
| ⚙ **Settings** | Image naming, window, download and browser options |

### 🏠 Home (download)

| Area | Description |
|---|---|
| **Site selector** | Dropdown to choose a manga website (built-in sites + your custom adapters) |
| **Comic name input** | Type the manga title |
| **Search button** | Searches the selected site; candidates are listed below; click one to auto-fill and open its detail page |
| **Need login** | When checked, a login flow runs before opening chapters: Open Login (browser login page) → scan QR / sign in → Login Done. **Login is saved as an encrypted container** (v1.1.1): next time the site needs login, the program auto-logs-in with the saved container — no QR scan needed. On this PC it unlocks automatically; on another PC you enter the container password; 4 wrong passwords destroy the container |
| **Load chapter list** | Reads all chapters of the comic (number + name), builds a checkable list |
| **Chapter list** | Select chapters to download (all / partial / range) |
| **Start download** | Downloads all images of the selected chapters (auto-creates `comic/chapter/1.jpg` structure) |
| **Retry failed images** | Retry images that failed before |
| **Retry failed chapters** | Batch-retry failed chapters |
| **Log window** | Live log of every step (search → chapters → images → download → cover) |

Folder structure after download:

```
ComicName/
├── 0/cover.jpg                 # cover (0-prefixed folder = cover directory)
├── 128 Final-Chap/
│   ├── 1.jpg
│   └── ...
└── 127 Side-Story/
    ├── 1.jpg
    └── ...
```

> Keep the console window open while downloading; close it or the main window to quit.

### 🔐 Secure Login Vault (v1.1.1)

Login sessions are stored in **encrypted containers** (`cookies/<site>_cookies.json`, AES-256-GCM + **Argon2id** key derivation since v1.3.1; PBKDF2 vaults from older versions remain readable and auto-upgrade):

| Behavior | Description |
|---|---|
| **This PC** | Opens automatically via hardware fingerprint — you are never asked |
| **Another PC** | Requires the **container password** (set when login completes, or in Password Manager) |
| **4 wrong passwords** | The container **destroys itself** — all saved login data is wiped permanently |
| Password rule | ≥ 6 chars, must contain **letters + digits + symbols** |

**Password Manager page** (sidebar → `🔐 密码管理 ▸` → open):
- View each site's container status (encrypted / needs password / destroyed / none)
- Set or change the container password (no old password needed on this PC)
- Test a password (careful: wrong attempts count, 4 = destroy)
- Clear a container (delete that site's saved login, requires re-login)

### 🔄 Format Converter page (merge manga into a book)

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Add folder** | Add a manga folder to convert |
| **Scan sub-folders (batch)** | Pick a comic root folder; every sub-folder containing images is added to the list at once |
| **Remove selected / Clear list** | Manage the list |
| **⚡ One-click whole-book merge** | **Merge all folders in the list (1 or many) into ONE file** (auto cover) |
| **Start convert** | Convert per current settings (whole book / per chapter, cover on/off) |
| Target format | PDF (universal) / CBZ (comic readers) / EPUB (e-book) / MOBI (needs Calibre) |
| Output folder | Where the result files are saved |
| **Per-chapter files** | Checked = one file per chapter (cover only on the first); unchecked = merge into one file |
| **Add cover to first book** | Default on: use the original manga cover automatically |
| **Choose cover image** | Pick any image manually as the cover (overrides auto detection) |
| Convert log | Live progress of every file |

**Cover rules**:
- Auto-detects a **0-prefixed folder** (e.g. `0/cover.jpg`) as the original cover; prefers `cover.*`, else the first image in that folder
- No 0-folder → no extra cover added; the first image naturally becomes the cover page
- Only the first book gets a cover; other chapters do not

**Supported image inputs**: JPG / JPEG / PNG / WebP / GIF / BMP (mixed formats OK)

**After conversion**: the source list is cleared automatically, ready for the next batch.

## 2. Supported Sites

**Built-in crawlers** (code-level adapters, most stable):

| Site | Notes |
|---|---|
| Tencent Anime ac.qq.com | Chapter list with names; direct image collection; chapters needing login/VIP are detected and reported |
| ManWa, Copymanga & other built-in sites | Built-in adapters |

**Custom adapter sites** (`custom-sites/*_adapter.json`, preinstalled):

| Adapter | Site | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kanman_adapter.json` | kanman.com | Image URLs in page JS variables; full and reliable |
| `zymk_adapter.json` | zymk.cn | Chapter pages redirect to kanman; compatible |
| `cosz_adapter.json` | cosz.com | WordPress gallery; supports lazy-load `data-src` |
| `manwa_adapter.json` | ManWa | Adapter example |

> Note: **paid/VIP chapters** are restricted by the site's account permissions (guests see preview pages only). After login, free chapters download fully; VIP paid chapters need a corresponding membership. The program never bypasses paywalls.

## 3. Adding Any New Site (Auto Analyzer wizard)

Open **Auto Site Analyzer** from the main window, 4 steps:

1. **Open & analyze**: paste the new site's homepage; the program analyzes search box / search entry structure
2. **Trial search**: type a keyword; the program lists candidate comic links (filter & fix rules)
3. **Analyze chapters**: open the selected comic detail page; the program scrolls / paginates to find all chapters (with names)
4. **Analyze images → save adapter**: opens a chapter page, analyzes image structure, generates rules and **saves to `custom-sites/newsite_adapter.json`** — reusable forever

After saving, refresh the site list: the new site works like built-in ones (search, chapter list, download).

### Adapter JSON fields

```json
{
  "site_name": "Display name",
  "site_url": "https://site.com/",
  "search": {
    "mode": "get",
    "url_template": "https://site.com/search?keyword={kw}",
    "result_js": "return []; // extract comic links [{url,title},...]"
  },
  "detail": {
    "chapters_js": "return []; // extract chapter links [{url,title},...]",
    "chapters_scroll": false,
    "chapters_reverse": false,
    "cover_js": "return '';  // cover image URL"
  },
  "chapter": {
    "images_js": "return [];  // chapter image URL array",
    "scroll_to_load": false
  }
}
```

- `chapters_scroll: true`: lazy-loaded chapter lists auto-scroll + click "load more" until complete
- `scroll_to_load: true`: lazy-loaded chapter images are scrolled into view before extraction

## 3.5 Browser Guide (download needs a browser)

The program drives a **local browser** to open target pages and collect chapter images. Here is how to use it with **Edge** or any other browser:

### Recommended: Microsoft Edge

- **Built into Windows** — the program auto-detects Edge, normally **no setup needed**
- To verify/switch: Settings page → Browser Settings → choose `Edge`

### Other browsers (Chrome / 360 / Firefox ...)

1. Settings page → Browser Settings → select your browser type
2. If the path is not auto-detected, click **Browse** and pick the browser EXE manually:

| Browser | Typical path |
|---|---|
| **Edge** | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe` |
| **Chrome** | `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe` |
| **360 Safe** | `C:\Program Files (x86)\360\360se6\Application\360se.exe` |
| **Firefox** | `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe` |

3. Save and restart the program.

### Logging into sites (QR / account)

1. Check **Need login** on the Home page
2. Click **Open Login** → the program opens the browser login page
3. Scan the QR / sign in → click **Login Done**
4. The login is stored as an **encrypted container**: next time this site needs login, the program auto-logs-in (no QR scan). See the vault section below.
5. CAPTCHA / sliders: follow the on-page instructions (you may complete them manually in the browser window).

> The browser window **closes automatically** after chapter loading / downloads finish — do not close it manually mid-download.

## 4. Environment & Installation

**Requires Python 3.10** (tested on `Python 3.10.10`), dependencies:

```
DrissionPage
aiohttp
aiofiles
execjs        # requires Node.js installed
pycryptodome
cryptography    # Argon2id (vault password derivation)
requests
requests_file
lxml
```

Install (admin shell):

```bat
pip install DrissionPage aiohttp aiofiles execjs pycryptodome cryptography requests requests_file lxml beautifulsoup4 img2pdf
```

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ (runtime for execjs).

## 5. One-Click Start

Double-click **`start.bat`** (auto-checks Python, network and dependencies, then opens the GUI).

> Missing module? `pip install <module>` then start again.

### Self-check & logs

- Every launch runs a **self-check** (Python version / required modules / network socket / core files / writable dirs); results go to **`startup_diag.log`**
- Unexpected errors are written to **`crash.log`** (so even a "black window flashed by" can be diagnosed)
- If a blocking error is found, a dialog shows the log file location

### Network repair (WinError 10038)

If the program reports a network-stack failure (socket error WinError 10038) or cannot reach the internet:

1. Right-click **`fix-network-stack.bat`** → **Run as administrator** (resets Winsock / TCP-IP / DNS)
2. **Restart your PC**
3. The program can connect normally afterwards

> Format conversion is fully local and works without internet.

## 6. Adding Your Own Site Crawler (two ways)

- **No coding**: Auto Site Analyzer wizard / "New Adapter" — generate a JSON adapter (see `Docs/How-to-Add-a-New-Site.md`)
- **Python**: "Crawler Source Manager" window → "New from template" → edit → save; sources in `sites_data/` are auto-loaded (see `Docs/How-to-Add-a-Custom-Crawler.md`)

### Standalone EXE (recommended for non-Python users)

`MangaNest.exe` (PyInstaller one-file build, DrissionPage bundled) is provided in **GitHub Releases**:

1. Download the release package and extract (the EXE must stay in the same folder as `sites_data`, `custom-sites`, `config.json`)
2. Double-click `MangaNest.exe` — no Python needed

> Site folders (`sites_data`, `custom-sites`) are read from the EXE's own directory; don't move the EXE alone.

## 7. FAQ

| Problem | Cause & fix |
|---|---|
| Black window flashes and closes | BAT line-ending/encoding issue; use the original BAT from the package, or run `python gui.py` manually |
| No module named 'xxx' | Missing dependency; install per section 4 |
| Chapter list shows numbers only | Old bug, fixed; new version shows "Chap N + name" |
| A chapter downloads only 1–2 images | Paid / login-required chapter; guests see preview only; check "Need login" and retry |
| Search shows unrelated results | Some sites' search APIs don't filter by keyword (e.g. kanman shows hot list); adapters apply keyword filtering + fallback |
| Missing chapters / can't reach next page | Lazy-loaded sites need scrolling; new version auto-scrolls + paginates |
| Downloaded images include UI pictures | Restricted to real images inside the chapter container |
| Converted PDF won't open | Old object-number bug; fixed in v1.1 — re-convert |
| Conversion still produces separate files | Use "⚡ One-click whole-book merge" to merge all folders into ONE file |
| "Self-check found problems" dialog | Open `startup_diag.log`; for network issues use `fix-network-stack.bat` (section 5) |
